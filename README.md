ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sadudee Poaliwat or you can call me Oak.
I'm an QA Engineer for over a year, so my work is not 100% with coding.
So this Github is created for my sandbox in purpose of learning new things

ðŸš§Learning Projects
-React (in progress)
-cypress (95% done)
-and more to come

You can reach me by email: SadudeePoaliwat@gmail.com
P.S. I have some doodle instagram, you can check it out at IG: @els.doodle
