ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sadudee Poaliwat or you can call me Oak.
I'm an QA Engineer for almost two years. Indeed, my work is not 100% invloved with coding.
So this Github is created as my sandbox in purpose of learning new things.

ðŸš§What am I learning
-cypress.io

-flutter

-penetration testing

-and more to come

You can reach me out by email: SadudeePoaliwat@gmail.com
P.S. I do some doodle on instagram, you can check it out at IG: @els.doodle
