ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sadudee Poaliwat or you can call me Oak.
I'm an QA Engineer for almost three years. Mostly, my work is 70% coding on automate tests and 30% on development thing (which is internally and non-disclosure :( ).
So this Github is created as my sandbox in purpose of learning new things in freetime.

ðŸš§ What am I learning
- javascript in frontend thing
- kubernetes and some devops stuff
- pygame (yea.. everyone loves game)
- and more to come

You can reach me out by email: SadudeePoaliwat@gmail.com
P.S. I do some doodle on instagram, you can check it out at IG: @els.doodle
