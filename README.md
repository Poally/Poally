ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sadudee Poaliwat or you can call me Oak.
I'm an QA Engineer for almost two years. Indeed, my work is just partially coding in some part of product.
So this Github is created as my sandbox in purpose of learning new things.

ðŸš§ What am I learning
- cypress.io
- javascript in frontend thing
- kubernetes and some devops stuff
- flask
- and more to come

You can reach me out by email: SadudeePoaliwat@gmail.com
P.S. I do some doodle on instagram, you can check it out at IG: @els.doodle
